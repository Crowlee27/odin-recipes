# odin-recipes

This is the first project of mine from The Odin Project. Only HTML at the moment, but will come back later in the course for CSS.

I also would like to add that I do not claim to come up with these recipes. These are recipes that i like to use.

Links to recipes are as follows.

Potato Soup: https://belleofthekitchen.com/instant-pot-loaded-potato-soup/
