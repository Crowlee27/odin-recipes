    <li>1/4 cup canola oil</li>
    <li>8 oz smoked sausage</li>
    <li>1/4 unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1/2 cup flour</li>
    <li>1 medium onion (<em>diced</em>)</li>
    <li>2 tsp minced garlic</li>
    <li>1 medium green bell pepper (<em>diced</em>)</li>
    <li>1 cup celery (<em>chopped</em>)</li>
    <li>1/2 lb crab legs</li>
    <li>1 tbsp creole seasoning</li>
    <li>1 tbsp chicken bouillon powder</li>
    <li>1/2 tbsp smoked paprika</li>
    <li>1 tbsp thyme (<em>fresh or dried</em>)</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>1 14 oz can tomatoes (<em>chopped</em>)</li>
    <li>6 cups chicken stock</li>
    <li>1 lb shrimp (<em>peeled and deveined</em>)</li>
    <li>1 tbsp gumbo file</li>
    <li>2 green onions (<em>chopped</em>)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup parsley (<em>chopped</em>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Lightly season the chicken with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Heat the oil over medium heat in a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven. 
        Then cook the chicken until browned on both sides, remove, 
        and set aside. Add the sausage and brown, and then remove. 
        Set aside.</li>
    <li>Melt the butter and oil in a large Dutch oven or 
        heavy-bottomed saucepan, then add the flour and stir until 
        smooth.</li>
    <li>Cook on medium heat, stirring continuously, for about 
        20-30 minutes or until it turns a rich dark brown color 
        - just like chocolate. Don't walk away from the stove 
        during this process, or it could burn.</li>
    <li>When you have achieved your desired color, 
        remove the Dutch oven from the stove and let it cool.</li>
    <li>Return the Dutch oven to the stove. Add the onion, garlic, 
        green pepper, and celery, and cook for 8-10 minutes-stirring 
        frequently.</li>
    <li>Then add chicken, sausage, crab legs, Creole seasoning, 
        chicken bouillon or cubes, paprika, thyme, bay leaves, and 
        let it cook for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Follow with the canned tomatoes and about 6 cups of chicken 
        stock, then bring it all to a boil and simmer it for 
        45-50 minutes. After that, add the shrimp and simmer for 
        5 more minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in file powder, green onions, and parsley. Adjust 
        the soup's thickness and flavor with broth or water and salt.</li>
</ol>
