    <h2>Potato Soup</h2>

    <p>Lovely, quick, and easy potato soup. All you need is a little
       preparation time and a pressure cooker.</p>

       <h3>Ingredients</h3>

       <ul>
           <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
           <li>1 medium onion (<em>diced</em>)</li>
           <li>3 cloves garlic (<em>minced</em>)</li>
           <li>3 cups chicken broth</li>
           <li>1 can cream of chicken soup</li>
           <li>7-8 medium sized russet potatoes (<em>peeled and chopped into 1 in cubes</em>)</li>
           <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
           <li>black pepper (<em>to taste</em>)</li>
           <li>1 cup milk</li>
           <li>1 tbsp flour</li>
           <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Garnish</h3>

       <ul>
           <li>5-6 slices bacon (<em>cooked and chopped</em>)</li>
           <li>sliced green onions</li>
           <li>shredded cheddar cheese</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Instruction</h3>
       <ol>
        <li>Add butter to the Instant Pot and turn on the sauté button. 
            Once butter is melted, add in the onions and cook for 3-4 
            minutes until soft. Add in the garlic and cook for one 
            additional minute until fragrant, stirring constantly so 
            that garlic does not burn.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken broth, cream of chicken soup, potatoes, 
            salt, and pepper to the pot, and stir well. Place the 
            lid on the Instant Pot and turn the vent valve to "sealing." 
            Cook over manual high pressure for 10 minutes, then quick 
            release the pressure.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, stir together the milk and flour in a small 
            bowl to create a slurry. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Once the steam has completely released and the pin has 
            dropped on the lid, open the lid and stir in the slurry. 
            Turn the pot to sauté and cook the soup for 4-5 minutes, 
            until thickened. Stir in the 2 cups of cheddar cheese and 
            stir until melted. Serve garnished with chopped bacon, 
            green onions, and more cheese.</li>
       </ol>
